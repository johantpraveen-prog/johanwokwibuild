it works with the not gates, electricity, the switches, the and gates, and lots of other sciences

## How to test

So you turn on and turn off the switches to turn on and off various lines. then to turn on or turn off the button you can turn on and turn off the big switch with the blue lines. the first switch on the row of switches on the side turn on and turns of the top one, the second one does the top right one, the third one does the bottom right one, the fourth one does the bottom one, the fifth and sixth one together does the bottom left line, the seventh one does the top left one and the eight and last one does the middle line.

## External hardware

resistor, pushbottons, a seven segment display, and a slide switch.
